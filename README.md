## README

Here there are some files I have made to practice C. For these files to run it's necessary a compiler. It is expected that the reader knows some concepts of C language.

## HOW TO RUN A C FILE IN RSTUDIO

These files were compiled on a Mac, so all the examples are made for that platform.

- Create a C file: (File >New File > C File)
- Save the file: Let's pretend the name is `hello_world.c`
- Go to the terminal: RStudio comes with a terminal, is near the tabs "Console" and "Jobs"
- Compile the file: Type in the terminal `make hello_world` (without the extension)
- Run your program: Type in the terminal `./hello_world`
